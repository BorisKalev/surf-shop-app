      "Shaun Murray and Greg Nelson agree that a solid foundation greatly increases a rider’s learning curve. Hyperlite’s Baseline is shaped specifically for creating that base and solid foundation. The Baseline has a wider overall profile built atop a Continuous Rocker, delivering a smooth carving board that gets more pop off the wake due to its increased surface area. The Variable Edge Design is forgiving between the inserts but then sharpens towards the tip and tail to provide the strong edge hold necessary for generating speed into the wake. The Baseline is simple and both Murray and Nelson believe that “Less is More” in their shared shaping philosophy. The center of the base is clean, clean water flow creates a smooth ride and softer landings, the dual tunnels easily allow water to enter and exit at the Baseline’s tip and tail.",

      "The Ronix Women's Krush offers a shape that recognizes your shoulders and hips are not aways parallel in wake boarding.",
    overview:
      "The women’s foundation to wakeboarding will have you riding centered over the board, with more control and feel on the water. There are two ways to ride a wakeboard. 1. Edging and driving through the wake where your speed from attack angle and pop will determine your lift. This requires a higher skill level because you’re dealing with different forces from the pull of the line and the timing of your jump. 2. Riding a thinner profiled board with more top water speed and less line load. This style creates a pendulum using more of a natural centripetal approach with less effort both on and leaving the water. Recently we put the Krush on a diet and took almost 20% of the weight out. Now a rider has more feedback with the water, less swing weight in the air, and easier transitioned turns. For over 20 years we have been designing boards recognizing that your shoulders and hips are not always parallel in wakeboarding. Your body is crossed up riding toe-side, and more inline riding heel-side, and every aspect of the Krush takes this into consideration for the proper foundation to your riding.",

For over a ¼ century Parks Bonifay has continually refined wakeboards; this shape has the biggest, sweet spot in the middle with even more volume in the tip/tail and an easier release off the wake with a rounded profile. Over the decades of Parks’s wakeboarding journey aggressive, reactive, and explosive have been replaced with smoother, less strain, and predictable. That started with the rockerline – we created an arc that allows any rider to go into the wake blindfolded and they will know exactly how the board will lift off the water every time. This easy take off also has more glide speed putting less strain on your body. To give the rider fast, free cutbacks, we “borrowed” technology from the golf industry and ran dimples through the entire bottom of the board to reduce friction from the water and create a board that will break free unlike any other shape out there. We continue to reduce the side cut of this series, and that added volume makes it easier to ride at slower speeds with more controlled landings.",
